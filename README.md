- Problem description: ...Throughout my short time in college, I have heard of a recurring problem with students which is missing class that are early in the morning specifically classes between eight and nine AM.
The transition from high school to college is specifically jarring for some since they might have been used to their parents waking them up.
I personally have the problem of sleeping through my alarms while other people just turn them off and go back to sleep.
